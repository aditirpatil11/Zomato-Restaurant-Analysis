# Zomato Restaurant Analysis

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of Zomato restaurant data using Power BI to derive meaningful insights. I sourced a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle and successfully integrated the CSV file into Power BI. To ensure data accuracy and consistency, I cleaned and transformed the dataset by identifying and rectifying errors. I developed key metrics, including the total number of restaurants, countries, and cities. Additionally, I designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize essential insights and trends in restaurant distribution and performance, enhancing the understanding of the dataset.
